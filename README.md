# The-Nature-Conservancy-Fisheries-Monitoring-Challenge

Hi there,

I have finished to code a complex deep neural network doing localisation _ kind of refinement _ sotft-attention _ classification . (It came after several hundreds of work hour, and It was my real first deep learning experience). I have imagined it and I think it might be interesting for you to see it. The localisation part was firstly inspired from a Google paper but I improved it ( when ideas came ).

Here is the link towards it : Deep Neural Networks for Object Detection https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiluZbV66zUAhWMJMAKHZ0YAZwQFggnMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpdfs.semanticscholar.org%2F713f%2F73ce5c3013d9fb796c21b981dc6629af0bd5.pdf&usg=AFQjCNF79vro3uwWMO53Sqh9Imh62uCl_A&sig2=s99ID2DpzYzbZq8DOkvmAg

The main ideas are the next ones ( I used KERAS to code it ):
LOCALISATION

# METHOD
1 ) From an image -> Create 2 images of different size and add same augmentation of data process . (3,w,h) - > (3,w1,h1),(3,w2,h2) usually == (3,2*w1,2*h1) but as I modified Resnet architecture, it is not the case .
## Explanation

The inputs shape were [(3,768, 1216),(3,1344,2240)] and I got masks of shape [(1000,18, 32), (1000,36, 64)]. Thanks to UpSampling , I was able to merge them so my networks was able to detect fish from different size. Sliding window were [(224,224),(112,112)]

2 ) Pass it thought a trained model as Resnet50 / VGG16 / VGG19 ( actually I cut it, and modified it in order to have the option "valid" on the AveragePooling2D.

3 ) Map features of this trained network to 5 outputs . Let me explain it here. It is the hard part . The idea is to make the network learn where the fishes are . So we create 5 masks with the value 1 where the fishes are and 0 if not, associated with an equilibrated weight mask ( sum of value of 1 == sum of value of 0 == better learning, so mask of size 100*100 and only I have 1000 1 and 9000 0 , weight of 1 will be 9 and 0 will be 1 ) for the loss function . The 5 masks correspond to one full , one left , one top , one right and one right ( see pictures to understand ) .
The network will learn here to output 5 masks (As shown in images below). So from the images with fishes, you create an image mask with 1 where the fish is and 0 if there is no fishes. You also create a weight mask to help the network focus on the 1. At first, we put np.zeros(height,width) but the most logic output was a mask with only zero because we were optimizing with mse (the fishes represent maybe 1-10% of the images). So we came up with some tricks improved a lot the results.

# TRICK 1:
Put as much weight on 0 than 1. If my mask is [[1,0],[0,0]], my weight_mask will be [[3/4,1/4],[1/4,1/4]]

# Really magic TRICK 2 
Allow the network to take more than the fish but prevent him to go far. As you can see in the images below. We have put a red security for the network to learn where to stop with the fishes, but let him the liberty to go further than the true rectangle.

Add a blue lines of 0 in the middle to help the network to predict better segmented true rectangles (right, left, top, bottom).
## REFINEMENT


4 ) This part is interesting : 
As we have right,top,left,bottom and full of the true mask. We had in idea, we might have better results if he learn to the network to extrapolate fron right and left to recompose the full, same with top and bottom. And recombine the 3 created masks (the full, extrapolated(left,right),extrapolated(top,bottom)) to reform a better full mask.


## SOFT-ATTENTION

5 ) As the mask give you information about where the network things the fishes are. By applying a softmax on it, you get a distribution of probability of where the fishes are. If you multiply it to the resnet output, you get solf-attention. If the mask of probability is perfect, only fishes features will remain. 

## CLASSIFICATION

6 ) We use the features from soft-attention to make a prediction
NETWORK OUTPUTS

So 2 inputs (the same image in input but with 2 different sizes but same augmentation ) and 9 outputs = [8 masks (5 : full,left,top,right,bottom) + 3 full ) + prediction class ]

## LOSS FUNCTION

Firstly, I used "mse" to make mask convergence faster, but I observed it tend to predict uniform output for fish class prediction.So I used [8*mse + categorical_crossentropy ]

## Conclusion :
COMMENTS

In my implementation , the localisation part is really great ( I didn t evaluate it but I evaluate it was able to find the fishes between 70%-90% of the times + able to find several fishes on unseen pictures ). But the network wasn t able to learn the classification part ( I might I have mixed things there ).

I HAVE ADDED SOME PICTURES FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING:

1 ) ORIGNAL IMAGE

2 ) ONE OF THE INPUT IMAGES AFTER DATA AUGMENTATION I did only flip vertical / horizontal + add random normal noise on part where the fishes weren t -> decrease overfit on boats .

# NOTEBOOKS

The fish directory juste need to have a directory with test and train to work (I hope)
The other ones in dump but sometimes interesting researches we made on it.
